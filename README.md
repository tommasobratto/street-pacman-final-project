==========================================
To try out the player geolocation feature on a GPS-enabled phone:

 - type ```npm install``` to install the required npm packages
 - startup the local server with ``` http-server ```.
 - if you don't have http-server, type ```npm install -g http-server``` in the command line
 - download [ngrok](http://ngrok.com/)
 - setup ngrok in your command line by typing ``` /Users/*youruserfoldernamehere*/Downloads/ngrok 8080 ```
 - open up the url that ngrok provides in your phone browser (with geolocation activated), example: ``` http://*bunchofnumbersandletters*.ngrok.com/ ```
